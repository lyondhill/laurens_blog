Fotogram is a free WordPress theme that you can use for whatever purpose you choose.

It is designed to be clean, fast loading, so that your content stands out.

It features two columns - left hand for navigation, and right hand for content - and is highly customiseable:

You can:

Change the background
Change the header image
Add a link to your Facebook profile
Add a link to your Twitter profile
Add a link to your YouTube account
Create your own custom navigation menu

Simply activate the theme, and then either select "Theme Options" to add links to your social networking pages, or change the Header image or background via the "Header" or "Background" links provided.  The header image is 992 pixels wide by 200 pixels high.

Each post displays it's own image - you can set these when editing the post - by clicking on "Featured image" and selecting an image - these thumbnail images are 245 pixels wide by 180 pixels high.

The Fotogram theme has been tested in Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari – seems to be working / displaying fine – though any problems/bugs then please get in touch, and I will try my best to help.

This WordPress theme is totally free for both personal and commercial use, as are the images supplied.

It should all be valid XHTML / CSS – has all been hand coded.

Hope you like

Emma :)
