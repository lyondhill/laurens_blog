			<h2 id="about">About</h2>
			<p>Zack 990 is a WordPress theme designed expressly for photobloggers.  The content area is large and designed to focus large images and videos.  Smaller visual content will not work well with Zack 990.  Special thanks to Joshua Weinberg whose vision guided development of Zack 990.</p>
			
			<p>Zack 990 also features:
				<ol>
					<li>A widget-enabled footer with special styling for all default widgets</li>
					<li>Special formatting, such as drop-caps and image captions</li>
					<li>Author comment highlighting</li>
					<li>Threaded comments for WordPress 2.7+</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			
			<p>Zack 990 was testing with WordPress 2.7, and I'd recommend upgrading if you haven't yet (not only for security reasons, but for the improved image handling and gallery support).  Zack 990 has been tested with Firefox, Safari, Camino, Opera, and Internet Explorer 7 on both OS X and Windows XP.  Internet Explorer 6 has not been tested, nor are there any plans to do so (my apologies, but really, it's time to upgrade).</p>

			<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
			<p>Zack 990 is installed in the same way as all other WordPress themes.  Simply place the extracted theme in your themes directory (usually <code>/wp-content/themes</code>).  Log-in to the WordPress administration panel, go to the "Appearance" section, and activate Zack 990.  If my explanation confused you, or you haven't installed a theme before, more detailed directions can be found in the WordPress Codex <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Using_Themes#Adding_New_Themes">here</a>.</p>

			<h2 id="uploading">Uploading Pictures and Galleries</h2>
			<p>Zack 990 was designed to work with content that is 990 pixels wide.  To ensure your images are scaled properly, be sure to change the dimensions of large photos to 990 pixels wide.  This can be done via the administration panel -> settings -> media.  
			</p>
			
			<p>There are a few formatting options to be aware of when uploading and inserting pictures into Zack 990.  The theme was designed to display captions for each photo.  If you do not add a caption, you will notice that images spacing collapses.  In order to remedy this, you will have to add the class "nocaption" to each image that does not have a caption.  Do not, however, add the class to the first picture, as you will shift the "more photos" link down.  The resulting code would look something like this:<br/>
<br/>				<code>&lt;img class="nocaption aligncenter size-full wp-image-29" title="_dsc8830" src="http://labs.andreamignolo.com/zack990/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/_dsc8830.jpg" alt="_dsc8830" width="990" height="658" /&gt;</code>
				</p>
			
			<p>Okay, I'm going to just go ahead and admit it, the image uploader and gallery embed really confused me at first, so I'll to document what I know for posterity, and maybe it will help some of you out.  If you already know how to use it, skip to the next section now, or just start photoblogging!</p>
			
			<p>The uploader is available for both posts and pages (herein referred to only as posts, since repeating "post and pages" gets tiresome), and can be used to upload various media in addition to photos, such as video and audio, though only photos will be covered here.  Before getting into the how-to of uploads, it's good to know how WP handles images and galleries.  When an image is uploaded to a post, the image is then linked to the post (whether or not the image is inserted into the post or not).  When more than one image is linked to a post, WordPress gives you the option to embed all linked images as a gallery (more on that in a minute).  It's important to remember that uploaded images are linked to one post *only*, and cannot, as far as I know, be cross-linked.  This becomes crucial to remember when creating galleries (and where I got really hung-up).  Because galleries are created with only the images linked to a post, you must upload all images you want in the gallery, even if you already uploaded it to a different post in the past.</p>
			
			<h3>Uploading and Inserting Images</h3>
			<p>To upload an image, go to <strong>Write -> Post</strong>.  In the upper-right of the post box you will see <strong>"Add Media:"</strong> with a list of icons to the right.  Hovering over the icons will tell you what each one does.  Choose <strong>"Add an Image"</strong>, and an upload screen will pop-up.  Since Zack 990 was tested with the uploader, we are going to be uploading images from our computer, so, under the heading <strong>"From Computer"</strong>, click the button <strong>"choose files to upload"</strong>.  As soon as you select your image and click <strong>"okay"</strong>, your image will begin uploading.  Once uploaded, you will be presented with an options screen for your image.  Go ahead and set the options for your image, and then choose <strong>"Insert into Post"</strong>.  Your image will be inserted and is ready to be published!</p>
			
			<h3>Inserting Galleries</h3>
			<p>Inserting a gallery is similar to uploading an image, but in this case you must upload more than one image to the post.  Once you've uploaded all your images you will be in the upload screen menu as before.  Go to <strong>"Gallery"</strong>, where you will see a list of images linked to the post.  If you need to change any options, go ahead and to that.  At the bottom of the list is a button labeled <strong>"insert gallery into post"</strong>.  Click on that, and it should insert the gallery shortcode into your post (<code>[gallery]</code>).  Save your post. That's it!  My explanation was probably a little dicey, so you should just go play around with it to get a better idea of what it does and how it works.</p>

			<h2 id="formatting">Special Formatting</h2>
			<p>Since Zack 990 is a photoblog theme, the special formatting is minimal, but you might be interested in using it.  Special formatting must be done through the HTML editor, not the visual editor.</p>
			
			<h3>Captions</h3>
			<p>Captions can be added either through the media uploader/editor or done manually (all video embeds must have captions added manually).  Be sure to use the HTML editor when adding captions manually:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt; This is a photo of us at a picnic, the bears look hungry but were quite nice. &lt;/p&gt;</code>
			</p>
				
			<h3>Drop-Caps</h3>
			<p>Drop-caps are used to make the first letter of a post larger than the rest of the body copy.  To use drop-caps, place a span around the first letter of a post, like so:</p>
			<p><code>&lt;span class=&quot;dropcaps&quot;&gt;O&lt;/span&gt;nce upon a time... </code></p>
			
			<h3>Text above the image</h3>
			<p>Text that displays above the image is accomplished by using the 'excerpt' field for a post. Anything that is written here will display above the image.</p>

			<h2 id="widgets">Widgets</h2>
			<p>Ocular Professor is a widget-enabled theme, though instead of the traditional sidebar, widgets are displayed in the footer.  All default widgets are supported in Zack 990.  There are a large number of third party widgets, and unfortunately I cannot test and support them all.  Apologies for this.

			<h2 id="thanks">Special Thanks</h2>
			<p>Special thanks once again to Joshua Weinberg - Zack 990 would not exist without Josh and his generosity in releasing the theme for the public.  And special thanks to <a href="http://scottwallick.com/">Scott Allan Wallick's</a> inspirationally detailed readme files.  They are incredibly awesome.  Thanks also goes to the WP forums, especially to all the people frustrated with the poorly documented gallery function.  Thanks for hashing out what you did, the extra functions, and the explanations.  And an extra special thanks to Mal, the best duck ever, who makes an appearance in this theme as Mal the Error Duck. </p>
